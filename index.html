    <h3>Research Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I'm widely interested in programming languages, formal methods,
      and theories about logic and computation.
      In particular, I focus on the following two directions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compilers and program analysis,
        with the goal of helping the software development process
        and improving software reliability/performance</li>
      <li>Theory/model-independent aspects of logic and computation,
        with the goal of obtaining fundamental results with broad implications on
        computer science, mathematics, and philosophy</li>
    </ul>
